  abstract = {In this paper the issue of the coherent structures of turbulence developing in wall-bounded flows is addressed. After a short historical synthesis, some basic concepts are reviewed and the idea of coherent structure is introduced. The phenomena occurring in the inner and outer regions of the turbulent boundary layer in conjunction with the most widely used event-detection techniques are considered, with reference to the large amount of mainly experimental results existing on the subject. The flow phenomena are described in terms of events occurring in the inner region, large-scale motions developing in the outer layer and dynamics of vortical structures. In the second part of the paper, methods for the eduction of the coherent structures of turbulence from the background flow and results obtained in the framework of each method are presented. The techniques involving the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor, the analysis of the Hessian of the pressure and the proper orthogonal decomposition are considered. Each procedure involves a particular definition of coherent structure that is supported by an appropriate mathematical framework and permits the analysis of a turbulent-flow database in terms of dynamics of coherent structures. This work may contribute to the dissemination of the most recent concepts and techniques now in use in turbulence research among fluid dynamicists.},

  abstract = {Free surface coastal models currently suffer from the difficulty of having to specify the global circulation during the initialization process and along the open boundaries. As an alternative to the long spinup periods, an original explicit approach based on inverse techniques has been developed. Data originating from in situ observations and/or ocean general circulation models are optimally interpolated over the small-scale grid in such a way that the tendency terms are reduced to physically consistent values. The errors on the ``true'' tendencies and the truncated nonlinear term are evaluated to compute the model covariance. The observation covariance matrix is divided into two parts: the homogeneous, isotropic matrix calculated with a global energy spectrum; and a parameterized nonhomogeneous, nonisotropic matrix. The inverse method is applied to the study of the interaction of a barotropic alongshore current over a narrow canyon. The transient processes following the initialization are drastically reduced and the analysis field can efficiently be used in a flow relaxation scheme along the open boundaries.},

  abstract = {Abstract. PISCES-v2 (Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies volume 2) is a biogeochemical model which simulates the lower trophic levels of marine ecosystems (phytoplankton, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and of the main nutrients (P, N, Fe, and Si). The model is intended to be used for both regional and global configurations at high or low spatial resolutions as well as for short-term (seasonal, interannual) and long-term (climate change, paleoceanography) analyses. There are 24 prognostic variables (tracers) including two phytoplankton compartments (diatoms and nanophytoplankton), two zooplankton size classes (microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and a description of the carbonate chemistry. Formulations in PISCES-v2 are based on a mixed Monod\textendash quota formalism. On the one hand, stoichiometry of C / N / P is fixed and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the external availability in N, P and Si. On the other hand, the iron and silicon quotas are variable and the growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the internal availability in Fe. Various parameterizations can be activated in PISCES-v2, setting, for instance, the complexity of iron chemistry or the description of particulate organic materials. So far, PISCES-v2 has been coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) systems. A full description of PISCES-v2 and of its optional functionalities is provided here. The results of a quasi-steady-state simulation are presented and evaluated against diverse observational and satellite-derived data. Finally, some of the new functionalities of PISCES-v2 are tested in a series of sensitivity experiments.},

An analysis of the energetics of symmetric instability is used to argue that the mixed layer can be at least partially restratified even when some SI modes are absent due to either large horizontal viscosity or coarse model resolution. Linear stability analysis reveals that in the idealized models the amount of restratification can be predicted as a function of the grid spacing and viscosity. The models themselves are used to demonstrate these predictions and reveal three possible outcomes in steady-state: (1) incomplete restratification due to viscosity, (2) incomplete restratification due to resolution, and (3) excessive restratification due to anisotropy of the viscosity. The third outcome occurs even on a high-resolution isotropic grid and in two separate numerical models, and thus appears to be a sort of robust numerical feature. The three outcomes are used to recommend criteria that a successful SI parameterization should satisfy.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces two methods for dynamically prescribing eddy-induced diffusivity, advection, and viscosity appropriate for primitive equation models with resolutions permitting the forward potential enstrophy cascade of quasi-geostrophic dynamics, such as operational ocean models and highresolution climate models with O\dh 25\TH{} km horizontal resolution and finer. Where quasi-geostrophic dynamics fail (e.g., the equator, boundary layers, and deep convection), the method reverts to scalings based on a matched two-dimensional enstrophy cascade. A principle advantage is that these subgrid models are scaleaware, meaning that the model is suitable over a range of grid resolutions: from mesoscale grids that just permit baroclinic instabilities to grids below the submesoscale where ageostrophic effects dominate. Two approaches are presented here using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques adapted for threedimensional rotating, stratified turbulence. The simpler approach has one nondimensional parameter, K, which has an optimal value near 1. The second approach dynamically optimizes K during simulation using a test filter. The new methods are tested in an idealized scenario by varying the grid resolution, and their use improves the spectra of potential enstrophy and energy in comparison to extant schemes. The new methods keep the gridscale Reynolds and P eclet numbers near 1 throughout the domain, which confers robust numerical stability and minimal spurious diapycnal mixing. Although there are no explicit parameters in the dynamic approach, there is strong sensitivity to the choice of test filter. Designing test filters for heterogeneous ocean turbulence adds cost and uncertainty, and we find the dynamic method does not noticeably improve over setting K 5 1.},

  abstract = {The role of submesoscale flows in setting stratification in the upper ocean over the annual cycle is investigated with a series of hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic simulations. Analogous to mid-latitude open ocean regions, the kinetic energy budget is dominated by the mesoscale eddy field. It is found that high resolution simulations which include submesoscale flows have a deeper winter mixed layer than non-submesoscale permitting simulations. The variance of sea surface temperature is also reduced as the grid resolution becomes finer. The mixed layer is deeper at finer resolution as the submesoscale flows lead to increased mixing at fronts which surround regions of warm, shallow mixed layers. This reduces the stratification at their base and so wintertime cooling can then deepen the mixed layer further. These results are in contrast to other studies which focus on the role of submesoscale flows in restratifying the mixed layer, and at odds with prevailing parameterizations of submesoscale flows. Alternative numerical configurations are investigated and the results are found not to depend on the particular numerical scheme chosen.},

Here we show that tsunami and IG-generated signals within the RIS propagate at gravity wave speeds ( 70 m/s) as water-ice coupled flexural-gravity waves. IG band signals show measureable attenuation away from the shelf front. The response of the RIS to Chilean tsunami arrivals is compared with modeled tsunami forcing to assess ice shelf flexural-gravity wave excitation by very long period (VLP; {$>$}300 s) gravity waves. Displacements across the RIS are affected by gravity wave incident direction, bathymetry under and north of the shelf, and water layer and ice shelf thicknesses. Horizontal displacements are typically about 10 times larger than vertical displacements, producing dynamical extensional motions that may facilitate expansion of existing fractures. VLP excitation is continuously observed throughout the year, with horizontal displacements highest during the austral winter with amplitudes exceeding 20 cm. Because VLP flexural-gravity waves exhibit no discernable attenuation, this energy must propagate to the grounding zone. Both IG and VLP band flexural-gravity waves excite mechanical perturbations of the RIS that likely promote tabular iceberg calving, consequently affecting ice shelf evolution. Understanding these ocean-excited mechanical interactions is important to determine their effect on ice shelf stability to reduce uncertainty in the magnitude and rate of global sea level rise.},

  abstract = {Since the 1970s, analytical models of coastal trapped waves (CTWs) have been developed using a first-order wave equation in the long-wave limit. Formulations of this kind require assumptions of a straight coastline with similar shelf bathymetry. These assumptions prevent the models from capturing the scattering and backscattering behavior of propagating CTWs that encounter changing coastlines, bathymetry, or shelf width. CTW modes from two different analytical models, one of which includes friction and stratification, are compared with CTW observations of velocity and pressure from a study region near the Outer Banks off the North Carolina coast in the United States. The coastline in the study region is relatively straight locally but is bounded by an estuary to the north and shelf narrowing to the south, both of which induce scattering. The models suggest that the CTWs in this region are insensitive to changes in stratification, implying that observed seasonal differences in wave magnitude are due to seasonal wind forcing. Furthermore, friction is found to be important, particularly for mode-1 propagation, but higher-order modes are prevalent despite the importance of friction. There is very poor agreement between the observed and modeled free and forced CTWs because of scattering. This lack of agreement indicates that this is not a globally applicable theoretical formulation because many global coastlines violate the basic assumptions.},

This results in typical upwelling patterns that are distinct (e.g., more persistent in time and aligned alongshore) from those of other better known systems, including Oregon and Peru where inner shelves are comparatively narrow. Synoptic to superinertial variability of this upwelling center is captured through a 4-week intensive field campaign, representing the most comprehensive measurements of this region to date. The influence of mesoscale activity extends across the shelf break and far over the shelf where it impacts the midshelf upwelling (e.g., strength of the upwelling front and circulation), possibly in concert with wind fluctuations. Internal tides and solitary waves of large amplitude are ubiquitous over the shelf. The observations suggest that these and possibly other sources of mixing play a major role in the overall system dynamics through their impact upon the general shelf thermohaline structure, in particular in the vicinity of the upwelling zone. Systematic alongshore variability in thermohaline properties highlights important limitations of the 2D idealization framework that is frequently used in coastal upwelling studies.},

This first paper (in a series of three) describes the transition in terms of the emergent flow structure and the associated time-averaged eddy fluxes. In addition to the mesoscale eddies that arise from a primary instability of the alongshore, wind-driven currents, significant energy is transferred into submesoscale fronts and vortices in the upper ocean. The submesoscale arises through surface frontogenesis growing off upwelled cold filaments that are pulled offshore and strained in between the mesoscale eddy centers. In turn, some submesoscale fronts become unstable and develop submesoscale meanders and fragment into roll-up vortices. Associated with this phenomenon are a large vertical vorticity and Rossby number, a large vertical velocity, relatively flat horizontal spectra (contrary to the prevailing view of mesoscale dynamics), a large vertical buoyancy flux acting to restratify the upper ocean, a submesoscale energy conversion from potential to kinetic, a significant spatial and temporal intermittency in the upper ocean, and material exchanges between the surface boundary layer and pycnocline. Comparison with available observations indicates that submesoscale fronts and instabilities occur widely in the upper ocean, with characteristics similar to the simulations.},

The emergent upper-ocean submesoscale fronts are analyzed from phenomenological and dynamical perspectives, using a combination of composite averaging and separation of distinctive subregions of the flow. The initiating dynamical process for the transition is near-surface frontogenesis. The frontal behavior is similar to both observed meteorological surface fronts and solutions of the approximate dynamical model called surface dynamics (i.e., uniform interior potential vorticity q and diagnostic force balance) in the intensification of surface density gradients and secondary circulations in response to a mesoscale strain field. However, there are significant behavioral differences compared to the surfacedynamics model. Wind stress acts on fronts through nonlinear Ekman transport and creation and destruction of potential vorticity. The strain-induced frontogenesis is disrupted by vigorous submesoscale frontal instabilities that in turn lead to secondary frontogenesis events, submesoscale vortices, and excitation of even smaller-scale flows. Intermittent, submesoscale breakdown of geostrophic and gradient-wind force balance occurs during the intense frontogenesis and frontal-instability events.},

  abstract = {This is the last of a suite of three papers about the transition that occurs in numerical simulations for an idealized equilibrium, subtropical, eastern-boundary upwelling current system similar to the California Current. The transition is mainly explained by the emergence of ubiquitous submesoscale density fronts and ageostrophic circulations about them in the weakly stratified surface boundary layer. Here the highresolution simulations are further analyzed from the perspective of the kinetic energy (KE) spectrum shape and spectral energy fluxes in the mesoscale-to-submesoscale range in the upper ocean. For wavenumbers greater than the mesoscale energy peak, there is a submesoscale power-law regime in the spectrum with an exponent close to Ϫ2. In the KE balance an important conversion from potential to kinetic energy takes place at all wavenumbers in both mesoscale and submesoscale ranges; this conversion is the energetic counterpart of the vertical restratification flux and frontogenesis discussed in the earlier papers. A significant forward cascade of KE occurs in the submesoscale range en route to dissipation at even smaller scales. This is contrary to the inverse energy cascade of geostrophic turbulence and it is, in fact, fundamentally associated with the horizontally divergent (i.e., ageostrophic) velocity component. The submesoscale dynamical processes of frontogenesis, frontal instability, and breakdown of diagnostic force balance are all essential elements of the energy cycle of potential energy conversion and forward KE cascade.},

The results of three dimensional numerical simulations, which solve the wave equation in a weakly compressible sea water domain are presented. The hydro-acoustic signal is compared to an underwater acoustic signal recorded during the event by a scuba diver, who was about 12 km far from the earthquake epicenter.},

Three analytical flow fields are used for a comparative evaluation of both local and non-local criteria, which allows a deeper understanding of the physical meaning of the considered techniques. 0 Elsevier, Paris.},

To date, the only TEWS already operating in the Mediterranean Sea is that run by the Italian Department for Civil Protection at the Island of Stromboli, located north of Sicily in the south of the Tyrrhenian Sea. An active volcano is located on the island. The landslides that often detach from the ``Sciara del Fuoco'' following eruptive activity may result in the generation of tsunamis that propagate around the island and toward the coasts of Italy. The implemented TEWS is therefore aimed at mitigating the risk of landslide generated tsunamis.},

  abstract = {Antarctic Bottom Water is the most voluminous water mass of the World Ocean, and it feeds the deepest and slowest component of ocean circulation. The processes that govern its lifecycle are therefore key to the ocean's carbon and heat storage capacity on centennial to multimillennial timescales. This thesis aims at characterizing and quantifying processes responsible for the destruction (synonymous of lightening and upwelling) of Antarctic Bottom Water in the abyssal ocean. Using an observational estimate of the global ocean thermohaline structure and diagnostics based on the density budget of deep waters, we explore the roles of basin geometry, geothermal heating and mixing by breaking internal waves for the abyssal circulation. We show that the shape of ocean basins largely controls the structure of abyssal upwelling. The contribution of mixing powered by breaking internal waves, though poorly constrained, is estimated to be insufficient to destroy Antarctic Bottom Water at a rate comparable to that of its formation. Geothermal heating plays an important role for the upwelling of waters covering large seafloor areas. The results suggest a reappraisal of the role of mixing in deep straits and sills, but also of the fundamental role of basin geometry, for the lightening and transport of abyssal waters.},

  abstract = {When averaging the equations of motion, thermodynamics, and scalar conservation over turbulent fluctuations, we perform the process in several stages. First, an average is taken over the microscopic scales of turbulence, including the centimeter-scale band in which the dissipation of kinetic energy and temperature or density variance occurs. The eddy-correlation fluxes that arise in this stage are called microstructure fluxes. Next, the equations are transformed into coordinates relative to the microscopically averaged isopycnals. Finally, an average is taken, relative to these isopycnals, over macroscopic scales of eddy variability, which may include the mesoscale band of planetary motions. Average transport terms, analogous to conventional Reynolds transports in fixed-depth averages, arise also from the macroscopic eddies. This is not so for density, for which no counterparts of macroscopic Reynolds transports exist on constant density surfaces. Only microstructure flux divergence, which is synonymous with diapycnal velocity, contributes to the density balance. Under the assumption that microstructure density variance production is in equilibrium with its molecular dissipation, the microstructure density flux has the form of the molecular flux of heat down the vertical mean gradient, amplified by the Cox number. Munk's abyssal recipe for the vertical velocity/diffusivity ratio can now be reinterpreted as the diapycnal velocity/diffusivity ratio.},

We review some of the basic generation mechanisms as well as their simulation. In particular, we present a simple and computationally inexpensive model that describes the seabed displacement during an underwater earthquake. This model is based on the finite fault solution for the slip distribution under some assumptions on the kinematics of the rupturing process. We also consider an unusual source for tsunami generation: the sinking of a cruise ship. Then we review some aspects of tsunami run-up. In particular, we explain why the first wave of a tsunami is sometimes less devastating than the subsequent waves. A resonance effect can boost the waves that come later. We also look at a particular feature of the 11 March 2011 tsunami in Japan \textendash the formation of macro-scale vortices \textendash{} and show that these macro-scale vortices can be captured by the nonlinear shallow water equations.},

  abstract = {Various approximations of the governing equations of compressible fluid dynamics are commonly used in both atmospheric and ocean modeling. Their main purpose is to eliminate the acoustic waves that are potentially responsible for inefficiency in the numerical solution, leaving behind gravity waves. The author carries out a detailed study of gravity wave dispersion for seven such approximations, individually and in combination, to exactly evaluate some of the often subtle errors. The atmospheric and oceanic cases are qualitatively and quantitatively different because, although they solve the same equations, their boundary conditions are entirely different and they operate in distinctly different parameter regimes. The atmospheric case is much more sensitive to approximation. The recent ``unified'' approximation of Arakawa and Konor is one of the most accurate. Remarkably, a simpler approximation, the combined Boussinesq\textendash dynamically rigid approximation turns out to be exactly equivalent to the unified approximation with respect to gravity waves. The oceanic case is insensitive to the effects of any of the approximations, except for the hydrostatic approximation. The hydrostatic approximation is inaccurate at large wavenumbers in both the atmospheric and oceanic cases because it eliminates the entire buoyancy oscillation flow regime and is therefore to be restricted to low aspect ratio flows. For oceanic applications, certain approximations, such as the unified, dynamically rigid, and dynamically stiff approximations, are particularly interesting because they are accurate and approximately conserve mass, which is important for the treatment of sea level rise.},

The focus is on the seasonal changes in the generation and dynamics. The results are compared with observations made near the shelf-break in early summer. They were obtained using a towed Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) on repeated tracks in the Bay of Biscay; this provides a synoptic view in a plane spanned by the vertical and the cross-slope direction. In the reproduction of the observed patterns by the numerical model, the presence of the seasonal thermocline turns out to be essential. However, the model results also indicate that its presence has only a minor effect on the integrated conversion rate (which is about 10 kW/m). The main region of generation lies deep and is seasonally independent; the presence of the deep permanent pycnocline does increase the integrated conversion rate strongly, by a factor two.},

One key property that makes the method especially suitable for climate simulations is its very stable numerical time stepping scheme, which allows for the use of a long density time step, as commonly employed with coarse-resolution rigid-lid models. Additionally, the effects of the undulating free surface height are directly incorporated into the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations. The novel issues related to local and global tracer conservation when allowing for the top cell to undulate are the focus of this work. The method presented here is quasi-conservative locally and globally of tracer when the baroclinic and tracer time steps are equal. Important issues relevant for using this method in regional as well as large-scale climate models are discussed and illustrated, and examples of scaling achieved on parallel computers provided.},

  abstract = {We present a theoretical and numerical study of the effective mean force exerted on an oceanic mean flow due to the presence of small-amplitude internal waves that are forced by the oscillatory flow of a barotropic tide over undulating topography and are also subject to dissipation. This extends the classic lee-wave drag problem of atmospheric wave\textendash mean interaction theory to a more complicated oceanographic setting, because now the steady lee waves are replaced by oscillatory internal tides and, most importantly, because now the three-dimensional oceanic mean flow is defined by time averaging over the fast tidal cycles rather than by the zonal averaging familiar from atmospheric theory. Although the details of our computation are quite different, we recover the main action-at-a-distance result from the atmospheric setting, namely that the effective mean force that is felt by the mean flow is located in regions of wave dissipation, and not necessarily near the topographic wave source. Specifically, we derive an explicit expression for the effective mean force at leading order using a perturbation series in small wave amplitude within the framework of generalized Lagrangian-mean theory, discuss in detail the range of situations in which a strong, secularly growing mean-flow response can be expected, and then compute the effective mean force numerically in a number of idealized examples with simple topographies.},

  abstract = {A hierarchy of hydrodynamical instabilities controlling the transfer of buoyancy through the oceanic mixed layer is reviewed. If a resting ocean of horizontally uniform stratification is subject to spatially uniform buoyancy loss at the sea surface, then gravitational instability ensues in which buoyancy is drawn from depth by upright convection. But if spatial inhomogeneities in the ambient stratification or the forcing are present (as always exist in nature), then horizontal density gradients will be induced and, within a rotation period, horizontal currents in thermal-wind balance with those gradients will be set up within the mixed layer. There are two important consequences on the convective process: 1) Upright convection will become modified by the presence of the thermal wind shear; fluid parcels are exchanged not along vertical paths but, rather, along slanting paths in symmetric instability. Theoretical considerations suggest that this slantwise convection sets the potential vorticity of the mixed layer fluid to zero but, in general, will leave it stably stratified in the vertical.},

  abstract = {Turbulent mixing exerts a significant influence on many physical processes in the ocean. In a stably stratified Boussinesq fluid, this irreversible mixing describes the conversion of available potential energy (APE) to background potential energy (BPE). In some settings the APE framework is difficult to apply and approximate measures are used to estimate irreversible mixing. For example, numerical simulations of stratified turbulence often use triply periodic domains to increase computational efficiency. In this setup however, BPE is not uniquely defined and the method of Winters et al. (1995) cannot be directly applied to calculate the APE. We propose a new technique to calculate APE in periodic domains with a mean stratification. By defining a control volume bounded by surfaces of constant buoyancy, we can construct an appropriate background buoyancy profile {${_\ast}$}( , ) and accurately quantify diapycnal mixing in such systems. This technique also permits the accurate calculation of a finite amplitude local APE density in periodic domains. The evolution of APE is analysed in various turbulent stratified flow simulations. We show that the mean dissipation rate of buoyancy variance provides a good approximation to the mean diapycnal mixing rate, even in flows with significant variations in local stratification. When quantifying measures of mixing efficiency in transient flows, we find significant variation depending on whether laminar diffusion of a mean flow is included in the kinetic energy dissipation rate. We discuss how best to interpret these results in the context of quantifying diapycnal diffusivity in real oceanographic flows.},

  pages = {34},
  abstract = {A fundamental issue in CFD is the role of coordinates and, in particular, the search for ``optimal'' coordinates. This paper reviews and generalizes the recently developed unified coordinate system (UC). For one-dimensional flow, UC uses a material coordinate and thus coincides with Lagrangian system. For two-dimensional flow it uses a material coordinate, with the other coordinate determined so as to preserve mesh othorgonality (or the Jacobian), whereas for three-dimensional flow it uses two material coordinates, with the third one determined so as to preserve mesh skewness (or the Jacobian). The unified coordinate system combines the advantages of both Eulerian and the Lagrangian system and beyond. Specifically, the followings are shown in this paper. (a) For 1-D flow, Lagrangian system plus shock-adaptive Godunov scheme is superior to Eulerian system. (b) The governing equations in any moving multi-dimensional coordinates can be written as a system of closed conservation partial differential equations (PDE) by appending the time evolution equations \textendash{} called geometric conservation laws \textendash{} of the coefficients of the transformation (from Cartesian to the moving coordinates) to the physical conservation laws; consequently, effects of coordinate movement on the flow are fully accounted for. (c) The system of Lagrangian gas dynamics equations is written in conservation PDE form, thus providing a foundation for developing Lagrangian schemes as moving mesh schemes. (d) The Lagrangian system of gas dynamics equations in two- and three-dimension are shown to be only weakly hyperbolic, in direct contrast to the Eulerian system which is fully hyperbolic; hence the two systems are not equivalent to each other. (e) The unified coordinate system possesses the advantages of the Lagrangian system in that contact discontinuities (including material interfaces and free surfaces) are resolved sharply. (f) In using the UC, there is no need to generate a body-fitted mesh prior to computing flow past a body; the mesh is automatically generated by the flow. Numerical examples are given to confirm these properties. Relations of the UC approach with the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach and with various moving coordinates approaches are also clarified.},

  abstract = {Three Algerian eddies (open sea big anticyclonic eddies in the Algerian basin, western Mediterranean sea) are studied in detail using altimetric and in situ data. To characterize their spatial structure we make use of the Okubo\textendash Weiss parameter, which allows to separate the flow into vorticity-dominated and deformation-dominated regions. The application of this parameter to geostrophic velocity fields obtained from Sea Level Anomaly maps show that the observed eddies have a spatial structure in close resemblance to that found in coherent vortices of two-dimensional turbulence. These eddies appear to have a rather coherent vorticity-dominated core region surrounded by an outer region dominated by deformation with a very complicated and variable in time structure. This analysis is also applied to CTD data collected across three eddies sampled between 1997 and 1998. From these data eddy cores are equivalently defined as the interior region enclosed by the maximum of azimuthal velocity, and are consistent with the horizontal structures seen in SLA maps. The distinction between the core and the outer region (circulation cell) is particularly important to understand the role of transport and stirring of properties associated to eddies, as illustrated by the observed salinity structure, some selected SST images, and drifter trajectories. The core is characterized by very small isopycnal salinity gradients, while the surrounding cell is characterized by a strong slope of isohalines with respect to isopycnals. Persistent stagnation points are observed around the eddy and correspond to regions of high values of deformation with respect to vorticity. These regions allow analyzing characteristic patterns seen in the corresponding SST images. In addition, drifters trajectories exhibit very different behavior when crossing such regions.},

  abstract = {A new three-dimensional cloud model has been developed for investigating the dynamic character of convective storms. This model solves the compressible equations of motion using a splitting procedure which provides numerical efficiency by treating the sound wave modes separately. For the subgrid turbulence processes, a time-dependent turbulence energy equation is solved which depends on local buoyancy, shear and dissipation. First-order closure is applied to nearly conservative variables with eddy coefficients based on the computed turbulence energy. Open lateral boundaries are incorporated in the model that respond to internal forcing and permit gravity waves to propagate out of the integration domain with little apparent reflection. Microphysical processes are included in the model using a Kessler-type parameterization. Simulations conducted for an unsheared environment reveal that the updraft temperatures follow a moist adiabatic lapse rate and that the convection is dissipated by water loading of the updraft. The influence of a one-directional shear on the storm development is also investigated. A simulation with a veering and backing wind profile exhibits interesting features which include a double vortex circulation, cell splitting and, secondary cell formation.},

  pages = {33},
  abstract = {This study examines the impact of turbulent mixing on horizontal density compensation in the upper ocean. A series of simulations model the role of mixing in scenarios initialized with geostrophically-adjusted compensated and uncompensated thermohaline gradients. Numerical experiments isolate the influence of mixing on these gradients using idealized conditions with zero surface heat and momentum flux. Prompted by theoretical considerations and observed consequences of mixing, a new non-linear horizontal diffusion scheme is introduced as an alternative to the standard Laplacian diffusion. Results suggest that when horizontal mixing is parameterized using constant diffusivities, horizontal density compensation is substantially unchanged as the gradients erode. Simulations using the new scheme, which parameterizes mixing with horizontal diffusivities scaled by squared buoyancy gradient, suggest that horizontal mixing can produce compensated gradients during this decay, but only at scales of 10 km and less. Reducing vertical mixing to small background values has a similar effect, increasing the degree of compensation at submesoscales. Reproducing observed compensated thermohaline variability in the mixed layer at scales greater than 10 km requires external forcing. These results show mixing's important influences on density compensation within the ageostrophic submesoscale regime. In the transition from a horizontally compensated mixed layer to a partially compensated thermocline, advection must play an important role; mixing alone is insufficient.},

First, the short-term performance of a one-dimensional model with KPP is found to compare favorably to large eddy simulations (LES), including nonlocal countergradient heat flux. The comparison is clean because both the surface forcing and the large-scale flow are identical in the two models. The comparison is direct because the parameterized turbulent flux profiles are explicitly computed in LES. A similar comparison is less favorable when KPP is replaced by purely downgradient diffusion with Richardson-number-dependent viscosity and diffusivity because of the absence of intense convection after sunset. Sensitivity experiments are used to establish parameter values in the interior mixing of KPP.},

  abstract = {The problem of the propagation of acoustic wave disturbance initiated by a boundary condition is used to simulate a disturbance of atmospheric gas caused by a rise of water masses. The boundary condition is a function of a dynamic variable that is defined on the border of the problem domain. In this work, it is chosen in such a way that its parameters and form correspond to disturbances in the gas layer produced by a tsunami wave at the air\&ndash;water interface. The atmosphere is approximately described as a 1D multilayer gas media with an exponential structure of density in each layer. The boundary conditions are set at the interface between water\&ndash;air and gas layers. These determine the direction of propagation and the ratio of dynamic variables characterizing an acoustic wave. The relationship between such variables (pressure, density, and velocity) is derived by means of projection operators on the subspaces of the z-evolution operator for each layer. The universal formulas for the perturbation of atmospheric variables in an arbitrary layer are obtained in frequency and time domains. As a result, explicit expressions are derived that determine the spectral composition and vertical velocity, by the stationary phase method, of the acoustic disturbance of the atmosphere at an arbitrary height, including the heights of the ionosphere. In return, this can be used to calculate the ionospheric effect. The effect is described by the explicit formula for electron density evolution, which is the solution of the diffusion equation. This forms a quick algorithm for early diagnostics of tsunami waves.},

  abstract = {T waves excited by earthquakes propagate along the SOFAR channel with low transmission loss, and therefore can be recorded on land-based seismic stations and hydrophones located thousands of kilometers away from earthquake epicenters. Early T-wave observations are mostly based on recordings by land-based stations due to the mechanics of the energy conversion of acoustic waves into seismic phases. Recently, T-wave signals have also been detected by ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) at deep ocean basin offshore eastern Taiwan, raising the question of how deep ocean environment affects the generation and propagation of T-waves. In this study, to understand how acoustic energy scatters and interacts with different seafloor topography, we apply the acoustic ray theory to simulate acoustic propagation in the presence of realistic seafloor topography and sound speed profile. Our simulations indicate that seafloor topography indeed affects the acoustic propagation pattern, part of which may reach deep ocean regions. We also simulate seismic energy of T-waves by stacking energy coming from a series of potential conversion points within a specific time-window. The stacked energy distribution expresses a pattern similar to the envelope function of T-waves, indicating that the long-lasting waveform may result from a series of seismic-acoustic conversion processes.},

It vanishes if the density stratification is horizontal and statically stable everywhere, and is positive otherwise. It is measured approximately by a weighted vertical average of the horizontal variance of temperature. In magnitude it is generally about ten times the total kinetic energy, but less than one per cent of the total potential energy. Under adiabatic flow the sum of the available potential energy and the kinetic energy is conserved, but large increases in available potential energy are usually accompanied by increases in kinetic energy, and therefore involve nonadiabatic effects.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new, unified modeling technique for the total simulation of seismic waves, ocean acoustic waves, and tsunamis resulting from earthquakes, based on a finite difference method simulation of the 3D equations of motion. Using the equilibrium between the pressure gradient and gravity in these equations, tsunami propagation is naturally incorporated in the simulation based on the equations of motion. The performance of the parallel computation for the newly developed tsunami-coupled equations using a domain partitioning procedure shows a high efficiency coefficient with a large number of CPU cores. The simulation results show how the near-field term associated with seismic waves produced by shallow earthquakes leads to a permanent coseismic deformation of the ground surface, which gives rise to the initial tsunami on the sea surface. Propagation of the tsunami along the sea surface as a gravity wave, and ocean acoustic waves in seawater with high-frequency multiple P-wave reflections between the free surface and sea bottom, are also clearly demonstrated by the present simulations. We find a good agreement in the tsunami waveform between our results and those obtained by other simulations based on an analytical model and the Navier\textendash Stokes equations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the tsunami-coupling simulation model. Based on this simulation, we show that the ratio of the amplitude of ocean acoustic waves to the height of the tsunami, both of which are produced by the earthquake, strongly depends on the rise time of the earthquake rupture. This ratio can be used to obtain a more detailed understanding of the source rupture processes of subduction zone earthquakes, and for implementing an improved tsunami alert system for slow tsunami earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Flash rips and surf eddies are transient horizontal structures of the order of 10 to 100 m, which can be generated in the surfzone in the absence of bathymetric irregularities. They are traditionally evaluated in a depth averaged setting which involves intrinsic horizontal shear instabilities and the direct generation of vorticity by short-crested waves. In this article, we revisit the processes of surf eddy generation with a new three-dimensional wave resolution model (CROCO) and provide a plausible demonstration of new 3D non-hydrostatic instability and turbulent cascade. We first present a quick overview of a compressible free surface approach suitable for nearshore dynamics. Its ability to simulate the propagation of surface gravity waves and nearshore wave-driven circulation is validated by two laboratory experiments. Next, we present a real world application from Grand Popo Beach, Benin, forced by waves with frequency and directional spreading. The generation of surf eddies by the 3D model differs from depth-averaged models, due to the vertical shear associated with shallow breaking waves. In this case, the generation of eddies from both horizontal shear instability and the breaking of short-crested waves is hampered, the former by stretching the alongshore current and the latter by inhibiting the inverse energy cascade. Instead, the vertical shear flow is subjected to forced wave group variability and Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz type instability at an inflection point. Primary and secondary instabilities generate spanwise and streamwise vorticity connecting small-scale eddies to larger horizontal surfzone structures. Streamwise filaments, appearing as 5 m wide ribs or mini-rips, can extend beyond the surfzone but with moderate energy. These results appear consistent with the velocity spectra and observed patterns of tracers and suspended sediments at Grand Popo Beach. The timescale associated with the mean shear-induced turbulence is several times the wave period and suggests an intermediate range between breaker-induced turbulence and large-scale surf eddies.},

Adapting the transformed Eulerian mean formalism to a shoaling jet, they propose eddy heat fluxes to be the driving mechanism for the subsurface countercurrents. Here it is shown that such a formalism relying on the existence of a residual meridional streamfunction cannot be applied to a shoaling jet, so that the eddy heat fluxes term in the zonal momentum equation cannot be rigorously justified. Moreover, the role of the zonal pressure gradient that was dropped in their study needs to be reassessed. Despite this mathematical questioning of Jochum and Malanotte-Rizzoli's framework, the authors agree with them that eddy heat fluxes may contribute to the dynamics of the subsurface countercurrents.},

  abstract = {Potential temperature is used in oceanography as though it is a conservative variable like salinity; however, turbulent mixing processes conserve enthalpy and usually destroy potential temperature. This negative production of potential temperature is similar in magnitude to the well-known production of entropy that always occurs during mixing processes. Here it is shown that potential enthalpy\textemdash the enthalpy that a water parcel would have if raised adiabatically and without exchange of salt to the sea surface\textemdash is more conservative than potential temperature by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it is shown that a flux of potential enthalpy can be called ``the heat flux'' even though potential enthalpy is undefined up to a linear function of salinity. The exchange of heat across the sea surface is identically the flux of potential enthalpy. This same flux is not proportional to the flux of potential temperature because of variations in heat capacity of up to 5\%. The geothermal heat flux across the ocean floor is also approximately the flux of potential enthalpy with an error of no more that 0.15\%. These results prove that potential enthalpy is the quantity whose advection and diffusion is equivalent to advection and diffusion of ``heat'' in the ocean. That is, it is proven that to very high accuracy, the first law of thermodynamics in the ocean is the conservation equation of potential enthalpy. It is shown that potential enthalpy is to be preferred over the Bernoulli function. A new temperature variable called ``conservative temperature'' is advanced that is simply proportional to potential enthalpy. It is shown that present ocean models contain typical errors of 0.1\cyrchar\CYRNJE C and maximum errors of 1.4\cyrchar\CYRNJE C in their temperature because of the neglect of the nonconservative production of potential temperature. The meridional flux of heat through oceanic sections found using this conservative approach is different by up to 0.4\% from that calculated by the approach used in present ocean models in which the nonconservative nature of potential temperature is ignored and the specific heat at the sea surface is assumed to be constant. An alternative approach that has been recommended and is often used with observed section data, namely, calculating the meridional heat flux using the specific heat (at zero pressure) and potential temperature, rests on an incorrect theoretical foundation, and this estimate of heat flux is actually less accurate than simply using the flux of potential temperature with a constant heat capacity.},

The mean current has an Eulerian volume transport to the right of the wind  and  against the Stokes drift. The turbulent vertical fluxes of momentum and  tracers are  enhanced by the presence of the Stokes drift, as are the turbulent kinetic   energy and its dissipation and the skewness of vertical velocity. The dominant   coherent structure in the turbulence is a Langmuir cell, which has its   strongest vorticity aligned longitudinally (with the wind and waves) and   intensified near the surface on the scale of the  Stokes drift profile. Associated with this are down-wind surface convergence  zones  connected to interior circulations whose horizontal divergence axis is  rotated about  45\textdegree{} to the right of the wind. The horizontal scale of the Langmuir  cells  expands with depth, and there are also intense motions on a scale finer  than  the dominant cells very near the surface. In a turbulent PBL, Langmuir  cells  have irregular patterns with finite correlation scales in space and time,  and  they undergo occasional mergers in the vicinity of Y-junctions between   convergence zones.},

The addition of swell causes an amplification of the Lagrangian-mean current and rotation toward the swell-wave direction, a fattening of the Ekman velocity spiral and associated vertical Reynolds stress profile, an amplification of the inertial current response, an enhancement of turbulent variance and buoyancy entrainment rate from the pycnocline, and\textemdash for very large swell\textemdash an upscaling of the coherent Langmuir circulation patterns. Implications are discussed for the parameterization of Langmuir turbulence influences on the mean current profile and the material entrainment rate in oceanic circulation models. In particular, even though the turbulent kinetic energy monotonically increases with wave amplitude inversely expressed by the turbulent Langmuir number La, the Lagrangian shear eddy viscosity profile kL(z) is a nonmonotonic function of La, first increasing with increasing wave amplitude up to approximately the wind-wave equilibrium level, then decreasing with additional swell-wave amplitude.

  abstract = {Define the submesoscale regime as the geophysical fluid dynamics that arise from advective processes and that have a marginal degree of dynamical control by planetary rotation and stable density stratification. The degrees are conventionally measured by a Rossby number, Ro=V/fL (V a horizontal speed, f the Coriolis frequency, L a horizontal length), and a Froude number, Fr=V/NH (N a stratification frequency, H a vertical length), respectively; small Ro, Fr imply strong control. This regime lies in between the highly anisotropic (H{$\ll$}L) planetary and mesoscale regimes on larger scales \textemdash{} with small Ro, Fr, hence approximate diagnostic force balances: geostrophic in the horizontal direction and hydrostatic in the vertical direction \textemdash{} and the more isotropic microscale regime \textemdash{} with large Ro, Fr, hence little or no rotational, stratified control and frequent violations of diagnostic force balance. The activation of the submesoscale is primarily by energy transfer from mesoscale flows. Submesoscale turbulence occurs in both the ocean and atmosphere on horizontal scales {$\leq$} O(10){$\leq$} O(10)\textbackslash leq \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\}(10) km and time scales {$\leq$} O(105){$\leq$} O(105)\textbackslash leq \textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\}(10\^\{5\}) s. Inertia-gravity waves are considered a separate phenomenon since they have primarily non-advective generation and evolution, although they often co-populate the same space and time scales as submesoscale flows. Clouds are also considered as a separate phenomenon not considered here. Thus, the submesoscale regime is perhaps less simply matched to the atmosphere than the ocean, though relevant for both. My focus below is oceanic.},

This paper attempts at unifying existing observations and theories to present our current understanding of this jets system. Recent in situ observations suggesting a continuity between DEC and DTC are confronted against the various generation mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature. The key notion to differentiate these previous studies lies in the so-called ``cascade of mechanisms,'' that is, the energy pathway and equilibration processes chain that lead to the jets from their initial energy source. Many studies see the deep equatorial intraseasonal variability as the initial energy source, highlighting its key role in energizing the DEC and DTC. However, critical gaps remain in this cascade of mechanisms and limit substantially our ability to represent the jets in Ocean Global Circulation Models. This paper aims at identifying such gaps and propose future research directions.},

A persistent feature is high acoustic backscatter beginning in the vicinity of the wave trough and continuing through its trailing edge and wake. This is demonstrated to be due to enhanced density microstructure. Increased small-scale strain ahead of the wave trough compresses select density interfaces, thereby locally increasing stratification. This is followed by a sequence of overturning, high-density microstructure, and turbulence at the interface, which is coincident with the high acoustic backscatter. The Richardson number estimated from observations is larger than 1/4, indicating that the interface is stable. However, density profiles reveal these preturbulent interfaces to be O(10 cm) thick, much thinner than can be resolved with shipboard velocity measurements. By assuming that streamlines parallel isopycnals ahead of the wave trough, a velocity profile is inferred in which the shear is sufficiently high to create explosively growing, small wavelength shear instabilities. It is argued that this is the generation mechanism for the observed turbulence and hence the persistent structure of high acoustic backscatter in these internal solitary waves.},

Using the high resolution COSMO-REA2 data set, 3D composites of the PV, with and without Coriolis parameter and related variables, are evaluated for different classes of precipitation intensity. The development of a significant horizontal dipole structure in the immediate vicinity of the precipitation maximum and the updraft can be explained by the twisting term in the vorticity equation. This is because the vorticity equation is proportional to the PV equation for strong convective processes. This theoretical is important on the convective scale without the consideration of the Coriolis effect, which is a typical characteristic on the synoptic scale. In accordance to previous studies, the horizontal PV dipole is statistically confirmed by 3D composites of the PV and corresponding variables. We show that the dipole structures are especially distinct for the relative PV without Coriolis parameter and the relative vorticity. On the convective scale, the thermodynamical sources and sinks of the potential vorticity indicate the diabatic processes that are related to conservative vortex dynamics via the proportionality of the diabatic heating and the vertical velocity. This work confirms that the PV equation is an important tool in atmospheric dynamics that unifies the thermodynamical processes as well as the dynamical processes into one scalar.},

Considering water column as a compressible medium we processed the bottom pressure records in order to estimate amplitude, duration and velocity of bottom displacement. Spectral analysis of the records revealed a clear manifestation of the low-frequency elastic oscillations of water column. We also presented 3-D finite-difference numerical model developed in the framework of linear potential theory of ideal compressible fluid to better understand dynamical processes in the tsunami source. The model reproduces position of the main spectral maximum rather correctly. However, due to neglecting of crust elasticity and to lack of exact knowledge of spatiotemporal laws of bottom motion, there is an essential difference between in-situ observed and computed spectra.},

Estimations we made show that this approach quite appropriately describes the stages of tsunami propagation and run-up, whereas incompressible fluid theory fails to describe the process of tsunami generation properly. Comparative studies of wave generation by piston bottom displacements in compressible and incompressible fluids have been carried out within the framework of linear potential theory. The analysis of exact analytical solutions to the problem has shown that a substantial difference exists between the behaviour of compressible and incompressible fluids under typical tsunami source conditions. It was also shown that bottom displacements of seismic origin must give rise to standing acoustic waves in the source region. As a result each tsunami should have its own ``voice'', the characteristics of which depend on bottom topography, sediment features and on the time history and spatial structure of the bottom displacement. This ``voice'' may serve as an additional important tool for tsunami forecasting.},

Numerical solutions of the two-dimensional case show that despite this  anti-turbulence theorem, horizontal convection exhibits a transition to eddying flow,  provided that the Rayleigh number is sufficiently high, or the Prandtl number {$\sigma$}  sufficiently small. We speculate that horizontal convection is an example of a flow  with a large number of active modes which is nonetheless not `truly turbulent' because  {$\epsilon\rightarrow$}0 in the inviscid limit.},

Our purpose in developing a core curriculum was to provide to advanced undergraduates and entering graduate students a coherent and systematic introduction to the theory of geophysical fluid dynamics. The curriculum and the outline of this book were devised to form a sequence of courses of roughly one and a half academic years (five academic quarters) in length. The goal of the sequence is to help the student rapidly advance to the point where independent study and research are practical expectations. It quickly became apparent that several topics (e. g. , some aspects of potential theory) usually thought of as forming the foundations of a fluid-dynamics curriculum were merely classical rather than essential and could be, however sadly, dispensed with for our purposes. At the same time, the diversity of interests of our students is so great that no curriculum can truly be exhaust ive in such a curriculum period. It seems to me that the best that can be achieved as a compromise is a systematic introduction to some important segment of the total scope of geophysical fluid dynamics which is illustrative of its most fruitful methods.},

  abstract = {Ocean-Waves-Atmosphere (OWA) exchanges are not well represented in current Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, which can lead to large uncertainties in tropical cyclone track and intensity forecasts. In order to explore and better understand the impact of OWA interactions on tropical cyclone modeling, a fully coupled OWA system based on the atmospheric model Meso-NH, the oceanic model CROCO, and the wave model WW3 and called MSWC was designed and applied to the case of tropical cyclone Bejisa (2013\textendash 2014). The fully coupled OWA simulation shows good agreement with the literature and available observations. In particular, simulated significant wave height is within 30 cm of measurements made with buoys and altimeters. Short-term ({$<$} 2 days) sensitivity experiments used to highlight the effect of oceanic waves coupling show limited impact on the track, the intensity evolution, and the turbulent surface fluxes of the tropical cyclone. However, it is also shown that using a fully coupled OWA system is essential to obtain consistent sea salt emissions. Spatial and temporal coherence of the sea state with the 10 m wind speed are necessary to produce sea salt aerosol emissions in the right place (in the eyewall of the tropical cyclone) and with the right size distribution, which is critical for cloud microphysics.},

In this paper, a mean velocity profile expression is proposed for wall-bounded turbulent flows based on a recently proposed stochastic representation of fluid flows dynamics. This original approach, called modeling under location uncertainty, introduces in a rigorous way a subgrid term generalizing the eddy-viscosity assumption and an eddy-induced advection term resulting from turbulence inhomogeneity. This latter term gives rise to a theoretically well-grounded model for the transitional zone between the viscous sublayer and the turbulent sublayer. An expression of the small-scale velocity component is also provided in the viscous zone. Numerical assessments of the results are provided for turbulent boundary layer flows, pipe flows and channel flows at various Reynolds numbers.},

  abstract = {The study of the mechanical energy budget of the oceans using the Lorenz available potential energy (APE) theory is based on knowledge of the adiabatically rearranged Lorenz reference state of minimum potential energy. The compressible and nonlinear character of the equation of state for seawater has been thought to cause the reference state to be ill defined, casting doubt on the usefulness of APE theory for investigating ocean energetics under realistic conditions. Using a method based on the volume frequency distribution of parcels as a function of temperature and salinity in the context of the seawater Boussinesq approximation, which is illustrated using climatological data, the authors show that compressibility effects are in fact minor. The reference state can be regarded as a well-defined one-dimensional function of depth, which forms a surface in temperature, salinity, and density space between the surface and the bottom of the ocean. For a very small proportion of water masses, this surface can be multivalued and water parcels can have up to two statically stable levels in the reference density profile, of which the shallowest is energetically more accessible. Classifying parcels from the surface to the bottom gives a different reference density profile than classifying in the opposite direction. However, this difference is negligible. This study shows that the reference state obtained by standard sorting methods is equivalent to, though computationally more expensive than, the volume frequency distribution approach. The approach that is presented can be applied systematically and in a computationally efficient manner to investigate the APE budget of the ocean circulation using models or climatological data.},

  abstract = {The kinetic energy (KE) seasonality has been revealed by satellite altimeters in many oceanic regions. Question about the mechanisms that trigger this seasonality is still challenging. We address this question through the comparison of two numerical simulations. The first one, with a 1/10\textdegree{} horizontal grid spacing, 54 vertical levels, represents dynamics of physical scales larger than 50 km. The second one, with a 1/30\textdegree{} grid spacing, 100 vertical levels, takes into account the dynamics of physical scales down to 16 km. Comparison clearly emphasizes in the whole North Pacific Ocean, not only a significant KE increase by a factor up to three, but also the emergence of seasonal variability when the scale range 16\textendash 50 km (called submesoscales in this study) is taken into account. But the mechanisms explaining these KE changes display strong regional contrasts. In high KE regions, such the Kuroshio Extension and the western and eastern subtropics, frontal mixed-layer instabilities appear to be the main mechanism for the emergence of submesoscales in winter. Subsequent inverse kinetic energy cascade leads to the KE seasonality of larger scales. In other regions, in particular in subarctic regions, results suggest that the KE seasonality is principally produced by larger-scale instabilities with typical scales of 100 km and not so much by smaller-scale mixed-layer instabilities. Using arguments from geostrophic turbulence, the submesoscale impact in these regions is assumed to strengthen mesoscale eddies that become more coherent and not quickly dissipated, leading to a KE increase.},

This raises the questions of why such constructions are required in the first place, and whether there is some general method of deriving the available potential energyfor an arbitraryfiuid system. By appealing to the underlying Hamiltonian structure of geophysicalfiuid dynamics, it becomes clear why energy conservation is flot enough, and why other conservation laws such as mass conservation need to be incorporated in order to construct an invariant, known as the pseudoenergy, tha\"i is a positive-definite functional of disturbance quantities. The available potential energy is just the non-kinetic part of the pseudoenergy, the construction of which follows a well defined algorithm. Two notable features of the available potential energy defined thereby are first, that it is a locally defined quantity, and second, that it is inherently definable at finite amplitude (though one may of course always take the smallamplitude limit if this is appropriate). The general theory is made concrete by systematic derivations of available potential energy in a number of different contexts. Ail the well known expressions are recovered, and some new expressions are obtained. The possibility of generalizing the concept of available potential energy to dynamically stable basic fiows (as opposed to statically stable basic states) is also discussed.},

The model spectra decay at the highest resolved wavenumbers compared with observations, indicating energy removal by the model's dissipation mechanisms. This departure from the observed spectra is used to define the model's effective resolution. Various dissipation mechanisms used in NWP models are tested in WRF model simulations to examine the mechanisms' impact on a model's effective resolution. The spinup of the spectra in forecasts is also explored, along with spectra variability in the free atmosphere and in forecasts under different synoptic regimes.},

  abstract = {The mathematical equivalence of the linearized two-dimensional (2D) shallow-water system and the 2D acoustic-advection system strongly suggests that time-split schemes designed for the hydrostatic equations can be employed in nonhydrostatic models and vice versa. Stability analyses are presented for several time-split numerical methods for integrating the two systems. The primary interest is in the nonhydrostatic system and in explicit numerical schemes where no multidimensional elliptic equations arise; thus, a detailed analysis of the Klemp and Wilhelmson (KW) explicit technique for integrating the time-split nonhydrostatic system is undertaken. It is found that the interaction between propagating and advecting acoustic modes can introduce severe constraints on the maximum allowable time steps. Proper filtering can remove these constraints. Other explicit time-split schemes are analysed, and, of all the explicit schemes considered, it is believed that the KW time-split method offers the best combination of stability, minimal filtering, simplicity, and freedom from spurious noise for integrating the nonhydrostatic or hydrostatic equations. Schemes wherein the fast modes are integrated implicitly and the slow modes explicitly are also analyzed. These semi-implicit schemes can be used with a greater variety of advection schemes than the explicit time-split approaches and generally require less filtering than the split-explicit schemes for stability. However, a multidimensional elliptic equation must be solved with each time step. For nonhydrostatic elastic models using the KW time-split method, an acoustic filter is presented that allows a reduction of previously necessary filtering in the KW scheme, and a method for integrating the buoyancy equation is discussed that results in the large time step being limited by a Courant condition based on the advection velocity and not on the fastest gravity-wave speed.},

  abstract = {The increase of model resolution naturally leads to the representation of a wider energy spectrum. As a result, in recent years, the understanding of oceanic submesoscale dynamics has significantly improved. However, dissipation in submesoscale models remains dominated by numerical constraints rather than physical ones. Effective resolution is limited by the numerical dissipation range, which is a function of the model numerical filters (assuming that dispersive numerical modes are efficiently removed). We present a Baroclinic jet test case set in a zonally reentrant channel that provides a controllable test of a model capacity at resolving submesoscale dynamics. We compare simulations from two models, ROMS and NEMO, at different mesh sizes (from 20 to 2 km). Through a spectral decomposition of kinetic energy and its budget terms, we identify the characteristics of numerical dissipation and effective resolution. It shows that numerical dissipation appears in different parts of a model, especially in spatial advectiondiffusion schemes for momentum equations (KE dissipation) and tracer equations (APE dissipation) and in the time stepping algorithms. Effective resolution, defined by scale-selective dissipation, is inadequate to qualify traditional ocean models with low-order spatial and temporal filters, even at high grid resolution. High-order methods are better suited to the concept and probably unavoidable. Fourth-order filters are suited only for grid resolutions less than a few kilometers and momentum advection schemes of even higher-order may be justified. The upgrade of time stepping algorithms (from filtered Leapfrog), a cumbersome task in a model, appears critical from our results, not just as a matter of model solution quality but also of computational efficiency (extended stability range of predictor-corrector schemes). Effective resolution is also shaken by the need for non scale-selective barotropic mode filters and requires carefully addressing the issue of mode splitting errors. Possibly the most surprising result is that submesoscale energy production is largely affected by spurious diapycnal mixing (APE dissipation). This result justifies renewed efforts in reducing tracer mixing errors and poses again the question of how much vertical diffusion is at work in the real ocean.},

These processes mediate exchanges of momentum, heat, and gases between the atmosphere and ocean and thus are of global significance for climate. Surface waves grow primarily by pressure-form stress from airflow over the waveforms, and they dissipate in the open sea by wave breaking that injects and stirs momentum, energy, and bubbles into the ocean. Wave motions pump wind eddies that control fluxes across the lower atmosphere. Flow separation occurs behind steep wave crests, and at high winds the crests flatten into spume, which diminishes the drag coefficient. In the ocean the Lagrangian-mean wave velocity, Stokes drift, induces a vortex force and material transport. These generate Langmuir circulations penetrating throughout the boundary layer and enhancing entrainment at the stratified interior interface in combination with other turbulent eddies and inertial-shear instability.},

  abstract = {The hydrostatic equations of motion for ocean circulation, written in terms of pressure as the vertical coordinate, and without making the Boussinesq approximation in the continuity equation, correspond very closely with the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations written in terms of depth as the vertical coordinate. Two mathematical equivalences between these non-Boussinesq and Boussinesq equation sets are demonstrated: first, for motions over a level bottom; second, for general motions with a rigid lid. A third non-Boussinesq equation set, for general motions with a free surface, is derived and is shown to possess a similar duality with the Boussinesq set after making due allowance for exchange of the roles of bottom pressure and sea surface height in the boundary conditions, a reversal of the direction of integration of the hydrostatic equation, and substitution of specific volume for density in the hydrostatic equation. The crucial simplification in these equations of motion comes from the hydrostatic approximation, not the Boussinesq approximation. A practical consequence is that numerical ocean circulation models that are based on the Boussinesq equations can, with very minimal rearrangement and reinterpretation, be made free of the strictures of the Boussinesq approximation, especially the ones that follow from its neglect of density dilatation in the conservation of mass.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this paper, the concept of available potential energy (APE) density is extended to a multicomponent Boussinesq fluid with a nonlinear equation of state. As shown by previous studies, the APE density is naturally interpreted as the work against buoyancy forces that a parcel needs to perform to move from a notional reference position at which its buoyancy vanishes to its actual position; because buoyancy can be defined relative to an arbitrary reference state, so can APE density. The concept of APE density is therefore best viewed as defining a class of locally defined energy quantities, each tied to a different reference state, rather than as a single energy variable. An important result, for which a new proof is given, is that the volume-integrated APE density always exceeds Lorenz's globally defined APE, except when the reference state coincides with Lorenz's adiabatically re-arranged reference state of minimum potential energy. A parcel reference position is systematically defined as a level of neutral buoyancy (LNB): depending on the nature of the fluid and on how the reference state is defined, a parcel may have one, none, or multiple LNB within the fluid. Multiple LNB are only possible for a multicomponent fluid whose density depends on pressure. When no LNB exists within the fluid, a parcel reference position is assigned at the minimum or maximum geopotential height. The class of APE densities thus defined admits local and global balance equations, which all exhibit a conversion to kinetic energy, a production term by boundary buoyancy fluxes, and a dissipation term by internal diffusive effects. Different reference states alter the partition between APE production and dissipation, but neither affects the net conversion between kinetic energy and APE, nor the difference between APE production and dissipation. We argue that the possibility of constructing APE-like budgets based on reference states other than Lorenz's reference state is more important than has been previously assumed, and we illustrate the feasibility of doing so in the context of an idealized and realistic oceanic example, using as reference states one with constant density and another one defined as the horizontal-mean density field; in the latter case, the resulting APE density is found to be a reasonable approximation of the APE density constructed from Lorenz's reference state, while being computationally cheaper.},

Because the APE generation rate is the volume integral of a thermodynamic efficiency times the local diabatic heating/cooling rate, APE theory is often regarded as an extension of the theory of heat engines. Available energetics in classical thermodynamics, however, usually relies on the concept of exergy, and is usually measured relative to a reference state maximising entropy at constant energy, whereas APE's reference state minimises potential energy at constant entropy. This review seeks to shed light on the two concepts; it covers local formulations of available energetics, alternative views of the dynamics/thermodynamics coupling, APE theory and the second law, APE production/dissipation, extensions to binary fluids, mean/eddy decompositions, APE in incompressible fluids, APE and irreversible turbulent mixing, and the role of mechanical forcing on APE production.},

  abstract = {Although it plays a key role in the theory of stratified turbulence, the concept of available potential energy (APE) dissipation has remained until now a rather mysterious quantity, owing to the lack of rigorous result about its irreversible character or energy conversion type. Here, we show by using rigorous energetics considerations rooted in the analysis of the Navier\textendash Stokes for a fully compressible fluid with a nonlinear equation of state that the APE dissipation is an irreversible energy conversion that dissipates kinetic energy into internal energy, exactly as viscous dissipation. These results are established by showing that APE dissipation contributes to the irreversible production of entropy, and by showing that it is a part of the work of expansion/contraction. Our results provide a new interpretation of the entropy budget, that leads to a new exact definition of turbulent effective diffusivity, which generalizes the Osborn\textendash Cox model, as well as a rigorous decomposition of the work of expansion/contraction into reversible and irreversible components. In the context of turbulent mixing associated with parallel shear flow instability, our results suggests that there is no irreversible transfer of horizontal momentum into vertical momentum, as seems to be required when compressible effects are neglected, with potential consequences for the parameterizations of momentum dissipation in the coarse-grained Navier\textendash Stokes equations.},

These respectively represent the adiabatic compression/expansion work needed to bring it from its reference pressure to its actual pressure and the work against buoyancy forces required to move it from its reference state position to its actual position. Our expression for the APE density is new and is derived using only elementary manipulations of the equations of motion; it is significantly simpler than existing published expressions, while also being more transparently linked to the relevant form of APE density for the Boussinesq and hydrostatic primitive equations.

Such an analysis reveals indeed: (1) that the compressible work of expansion/contraction remains of comparable importance as the mechanical energy conversions in contrast to what is usually assumed; (2) in a Boussinesq fluid, compressible effects occur in the guise of changes in gravitational potential energy due to density changes. This makes it possible to construct a fully consistent description of the thermodynamics of incompressible fluids for an arbitrary nonlinear equation of state;  (3) rigorous methods based on using the available potential energy and potential enthalpy budgets can be used to quantify the work of expansion/contraction  in steady and transient flows, which reveals that  is predominantly controlled by molecular diffusive effects, and act as a significant sink of kinetic energy.},

The generic model, calibrated with this method, exhibits a greater range of applicabilitythan any of the traditional models. Strati ed ows, plane mixing layers, and turbulence introduced by breaking surface waves are considered besides some classical test cases.},

Although many of the same principles of fluid dynamics apply to both the atmosphere and oceans, textbooks tend to concentrate on the atmosphere, the ocean, or the theory of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD). This textbook provides a comprehensive unified treatment of atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics. The book introduces the fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics, including rotation and stratification, vorticity and potential vorticity, and scaling and approximations. It discusses baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, wave-mean flow interactions and turbulence, and the general circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. Student problems and exercises are included at the end of each chapter. Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics: Fundamentals and Large-Scale Circulation will be an invaluable graduate textbook on advanced courses in GFD, meteorology, atmospheric science and oceanography, and an excellent review volume for researchers.

  abstract = {Linear instabilities, both momentum-balanced and unbalanced, in several different u(y) shear profiles are investigated in the rotating shallow water equations. The unbalanced instabilities are strongly ageostrophic and involve inertia\textendash gravity wave motions, occurring only for finite Rossby (Ro) and Froude (Fr) numbers. They serve as a possible route for the breakdown of balance in a rotating shallow water system, which leads the energy to cascade towards small scales. Unlike previous work, this paper focuses on general shear flows with non-uniform potential vorticity, and without side or equatorial boundaries or vanishing layer depth (frontal outcropping). As well as classical shear instability among balanced shear wave modes (i.e. B\textendash B type), two types of ageostrophic instability (B\textendash G and G\textendash G) are found. The B\textendash G instability has attributes of both a balanced shear wave mode and an inertia\textendash gravity wave mode. The G\textendash G instability occurs as a sharp resonance between two inertia\textendash gravity wave modes. The criterion for the occurrence of the ageostrophic instability is associated with the second stability condition of Ripa (1983), which requires a sufficiently large local Froude number. When Ro and especially Fr increase, the balanced instability is suppressed, while the ageostrophic instabilities are enhanced. The profile of the mean flow also affects the strength of the balanced and ageostrophic instabilities.},

The concept of gravitational available potential energy is used to formulate an energy budget in which the evolution of the background potential energy, i.e. the minimum potential energy attainable through adiabatic motions, can be explicitly examined. For closed systems, the background potential energy can change only due to diabatic processes. The rate of change of background potential energy is proportional to the molecular diffusivity. Changes in the background potential energy provide a direct measure of the potential energy changes due to irreversible diapycnal mixing. For open systems, background potential energy can also change due to boundary fluxes, which can be explicitly measured. The analysis is particularly appropriate for evaluation of diabatic mixing rates in numerical simulations of turbulent flows. The energetics of a shear driven mixing layer is used to illustrate the analysis.},

The bound on {$\chi$} is used to estimate the generation rate of available potential energy               E                                a                              and the rate at which               E                                a                              is irreversibly converted to background potential energy via diapycnal fluxes, both of which are shown to vanish at least as fast as {$\kappa$}               1/3               in the limit {$\kappa$} \textrightarrow{} 0 at fixed Prandtl number               Pr               = {$\nu$}/{$\kappa$}. As a thought experiment, consider a hypothetical ocean insulated at all boundaries except at the upper surface, where the buoyancy is prescribed. The bounds on the energy transfer rates in the mechanical energy budget imply that buoyancy forcing alone is insufficient by at least three orders of magnitude to maintain observed oceanic dissipation rates and that additional energy sources such as winds, tides and perhaps bioturbation are necessary to sustain observed levels of turbulent dissipation in the world's oceans.},

When integrated over all parcels, this term yields the total available potential energy                                                                      \$\{E\}\_\{a\} \$                                               . The second term describes the energetic consequences of the compensatory displacements necessary under the Boussinesq approximation to conserve vertical volume flux with each parcel relocation. On a pointwise basis, this term adds to the first in such a way that a positive definite contribution to                                                                      \$\{E\}\_\{a\} \$                                               is guaranteed.

  abstract = {In mesoscale modeling the scale l of the energy- and flux-containing turbulence is much smaller than the scale {$\varhexagonlrbonds$} of the spatial filter used on the equations of motion, and in large-eddy simulation (LES) it is much larger. Since their models of the subfilter-scale (SFS) turbulence were not designed to be used when l and {$\varhexagonlrbonds$} are of the same order, this numerical region can be called the ``terra incognita.'' The most common SFS model, a scalar eddy diffusivity acting on the filtered fields, emerges from the conservation equations for SFS fluxes when several terms, including all but one of the production terms, are neglected. Analysis of data from the recent Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (HATS) shows that the neglected production terms can be significant. Including them in the modeled SFS flux equations yields a more general SFS model, one with a tensor rather than a scalar eddy diffusivity. This more general SFS model is probably not necessary in fine-resolution LES or in coarse-resolution mesoscale modeling, but it could improve model performance in the terra incognita.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations suggest that submesoscale turbulence may transform lateral buoyancy gradients into vertical stratification and thus restratify the upper ocean via vertical flow. However, the observational evidence for this restratifying process has been lacking due to the difficulty in measuring such ephemeral phenomena, particularly over periods of months to years. This study presents an annual cycle of the vertical velocity and associated restratification estimated from two nested clusters of meso- and submesoscaleresolving moorings, deployed in a typical midocean area of the northeast Atlantic. Vertical velocities inferred using the nondiffusive density equation are substantially stronger at submesoscales (horizontal scales of 1\textendash 10 km) than at mesoscales (horizontal scales of 10\textendash 100 km), with respective root-mean-square values of 38.0 6 6.9 and 22.5 6 3.3 m day21. The largest submesoscale vertical velocities and rates of restratification occur in events of a few days' duration in winter and spring, and extend down to at least 200 m below the mixed layer base. These events commonly coincide with the enhancement of submesoscale lateral buoyancy gradients, which is itself associated with persistent mesoscale frontogenesis. This suggests that mesoscale frontogenesis is a regular precursor of the submesoscale turbulence that restratifies the upper ocean. The upper-ocean restratification induced by submesoscale motions integrated over the annual cycle is comparable in magnitude to the net destratification driven by local atmospheric cooling, indicating that submesoscale flows play a significant role in determining the climatological upper-ocean stratification in the study area.},

The equilibrium mean vertical shear is highly supercritical, and the turbulence field has its maximum in kinetic energy at wavenumbers smaller than the wavenumbers of fastest growth predicted by linear stability theory. Wavenumber spectra obtained by averaging lengthy numerical integrations of the two-level quasi-geostrophic equations agree well with the predictions of a simple Markovian turbulence model. Analysis of the turbulence model suggests that the most energetic wavenumbers equilibrate from scattering of the temperature perturbations into higher wavenumbers by the barotropic adverting field. In the higher unstable wavenumbers, including the most supercritical, linear instability is offset chiefly by local rotations of the unstable structures by larger, more energetic eddies.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents the Meso-NH model version 5.4. Meso-NH is an atmospheric non hydrostatic research model that is applied to a broad range of resolutions, from synoptic to turbulent scales, and is designed for studies of physics and chemistry. It is a limited-area model employing advanced numerical techniques, including monotonic advection schemes for scalar transport and fourth-order centered or odd-order WENO advection schemes for momentum. The model includes state-of-the-art physics parameterization schemes that are important to represent convective-scale phenomena and turbulent eddies, as well as flows at larger scales. In addition, Meso-NH has been expanded to provide capabilities for a range of Earth system prediction applications such as chemistry and aerosols, electricity and lightning, hydrology, wildland fires, volcanic eruptions, and cyclones with ocean coupling. Here, we present the main innovations to the dynamics and physics of the code since the pioneer paper of Lafore et~al. (1998) and provide an overview of recent applications and couplings.},
